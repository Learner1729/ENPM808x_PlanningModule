 * @brief This file is used to define the member functions to implement AStar 
 * algorithm.
 *
 * Given a occupancy matrix of an environment in form of a txt file, along with
 * start point and end point, this class can compute a smallest path avoiding 
 * the static obstacles to reach the desired location, if it's possible. 
 * The output generated is a path, from start point to end point, or a message 
 * stating that the "Failed! Path can't be found."
